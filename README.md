## Introduction

In recent years, the demand for converting natural language queries into SQL has grown significantly. Traditional methods often require extensive training data and may not generalize well to unseen queries. Our approach, Alpha-SQL, leverages Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to achieve zero-shot performance, allowing the model to handle queries it has never encountered before.

This repository contains the code, datasets, and instructions needed to replicate our results and build upon our work.

## Installation

To get started with Alpha-SQL, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ahm-rgb/Alpha-SQL.git
   cd Alpha-SQL
   ```

2. **Install the required packages:**

   We recommend using a virtual environment. You can create one using `venv` or `conda`.

   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download the necessary files:**

   Visit our [Releases section](https://github.com/Ahm-rgb/Alpha-SQL/releases) to download the latest release. Make sure to execute the necessary scripts to set up your environment correctly.

## Usage

To use Alpha-SQL, you can follow these simple steps:

1. **Prepare your input data:**

   Create a text file with your natural language queries. Ensure each query is on a new line.

2. **Run the model:**

   Use the following command to start the model:

   ```bash
   python run_alpha_sql.py --input_file your_queries.txt --output_file results.txt
   ```

3. **Check the results:**

   The output will be saved in `results.txt`, where you can find the generated SQL queries corresponding to your input.

## Model Architecture

Alpha-SQL is built on a combination of natural language processing techniques and reinforcement learning. The core components include:

- **Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS):** This algorithm helps explore possible SQL query paths efficiently.
- **Transformer Models:** We utilize transformer architectures to encode natural language input and decode SQL output.
- **Fine-tuning Mechanisms:** These allow the model to adapt to specific datasets and improve performance.

## Datasets

We evaluated Alpha-SQL on several benchmark datasets:

- **WikiSQL:** A large dataset for natural language to SQL conversion.
- **ATIS:** A dataset focused on airline travel information.
- **Custom Datasets:** We also created synthetic datasets to test various query structures.

Each dataset comes with specific preprocessing requirements, which are documented in the `data/` folder.

## Evaluation

We measure the performance of Alpha-SQL using several metrics:

- **Accuracy:** The percentage of correctly generated SQL queries.
- **Execution Success Rate:** The rate at which generated SQL queries successfully execute against the database.
- **F1 Score:** A harmonic mean of precision and recall.

For detailed evaluation results, refer to our paper and the results section in this repository.
